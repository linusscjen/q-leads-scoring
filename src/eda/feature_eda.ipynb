The goal is to increase the conversion rate, with the CEO hoping to achieve a lead conversion rate of about 80%. Our task is to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score *h* have a higher conversion chance (IE create a propensity score)."

    "THe `ProfileReport` gives some great insights as a first pass. Our dataset contains 37 variables and 9240 observations. We see that `Prospect ID` and `Lead Number` are both keys for the dataset. The `Do Not Call` variable only has 2 true instances, making it an easy variable to remove in our modeling process. Our target variable `Converted` shows that about 38.5% of people in this dataset convert, slightly higher than the 30% mentioned in the prompt.\n",
